#   Weather App
### Description

    This is a small weather forecast app.
    Get the current weather forecast, tomorrow's forecast and up to 16 days.

### Usage

    When loading the application, geolocation is used to give the user the current forecast where they are.
    If for any reason the application cannot access geolocation, it can search the current forecast by city, town or country.
